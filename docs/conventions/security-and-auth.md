# Ducat — security & auth conventions

Moved VERBATIM from CLAUDE.md on 2026-08-01 (the split). This file holds the
full evidence — what each rule cost and why alternatives failed. The one-line
enforceable rules live in CLAUDE.md and point here. Additions follow the same
contract: rule line in CLAUDE.md, evidence here, never both in one place.

- `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` uses a `:` delimiter, NOT `$`. Next's `.env` loader
  expands `$name` and silently mangles a `$`-delimited hash down to "scrypt", so
  the gate stays up (non-empty) while every login fails. This cost a debugging
  session and appears nowhere else in the repo.
- Auth fails CLOSED on partial configuration. Setting EITHER
  `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` or `SESSION_SECRET` counts as intent to lock, and
  middleware turns intent-without-completion into a 503. Requiring both would
  fail OPEN on the likeliest mistake — pasting the hash into `.env` while
  leaving `SESSION_SECRET=""` from `.env.example` — serving everything with no
  login while the operator believes a gate is up.
- Session tokens carry a non-reversible DIGEST of the password hash, re-checked
  per request, so changing the password evicts existing sessions. Without it the
  natural response to "someone has my password" left every session valid for its
  full 30 days. A digest, not the hash — JWT payloads are readable by whoever
  holds the cookie.
- Middleware redirects NAVIGATIONS only, never Server Action responses. A tab
  left open past its session throws instead of redirecting, which is why an
  error boundary exists — without one the whole app drops to Next's bare error
  screen.
- The dev CSP needs `'unsafe-eval'` and a same-origin HMR websocket for Fast
  Refresh. Don't remove them while "tightening" `next.config.ts` — production
  gets neither.
